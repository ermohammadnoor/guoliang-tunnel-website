				4,000 hammers, 12 tons of steel... and quite a lot of chisels: How one of the most dangerous tunnels in the world was carved by just 13 villagers in remote China <button id="readMore" >(read more)</button>

							<li>Guoliang Tunnel Road replaced a perilous path that consisted of 720 mountain steps.</li>
							<li>It was started to build in 1972.</li>
							<li>After five years of toil and graft by just 13 villages, the new route was completed.</li>
							<li>Now the tunnel is a tourist attraction throughout China, as well as a main link for Guoliang.</li>
						</ul>

							<p>For several years, the 350 inhabitants of this isolated location beseeched the government for a roadway to connect them to the outside world, but their pleass fell on deaf ears. Undeterred, they decided that if the officials refused to help them, they would do it themselves.</p>
							<p>Selling their animals and other necessities for supplies, the people of Guoliang sent down 13 of their strongest workers. The team of men, not an engineer among them, set about carving a roadway inch by inch, using nothing but hand tools, patience, and determination.</p>

							<p>The stairs were very dangerous because they were steep, narrow and had no handrails. In 1977, 5 years after beginning their colossal undertaking, the villagers had managed to dig out 0.75 mi. of tunnel, 16 ft. tall and 13 ft. wide. While quite the amazing feat, a do-it-yourself mountain tunnel dug by hand is obviously not the pillar of safety, in fact in many spots of the tunnel, roughly carved pillars are the only thing keeping you from plunging to your death. </p>
							<p>Thirteen villagers worked on the project and it took them five years to finish the 1,200-metre-long tunnel, which is about five metres high and four metres wide. It was made to be wide enough to be driven along, during which time they used up more than 12 tons of drill rods and 4,000 hammers .</p>

							<p>Several villagers died during construction, and the road itself is only wide enough for the very slow, careful passing of oncoming cars. This is made terrifying by the fact that the road was built on the path of least resistance. The tunnel twists, turns and dips in unpredictable places, enough to leave any driver white-knuckled in terror at what could be coming at them around the slippery blind spot of a bend.</p>
							<p>Originally intentioned to provide the Guoliang residents with some convenience, the tunnel has become quite the tourist attraction, giving the village a little too much unwanted attention, but some very welcome revenue. There are now hotels and bridges that have been built for hikers and travelers, but access isnâ€™t always granted, so make sure to check the internet for updates on the current visiting status.</p>
